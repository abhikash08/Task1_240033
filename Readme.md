GAME IDEA :
This is a 2D platformer game where the main objective is to reach the other end of the cave and landing on the fire on the last platform
collecting treasure boxes and also defeating the red scarfed knight in the way.

The Game consists of 4 scenes : HOME , GAMEPLAY , DEATH , WIN.
All the scripts are inside Assets -> Samples -> Scripts.

**DISCLAIMER**
*The platforms sometimes get behind the background and sometimes work fine. I have sorted the layers correctly but still this issue is persisting so please while testing out my game please either restart or die and play again. I will attach photos of my scene view and game view in the google drive that will contain the build of my game

CONTROLS :
A -> Move right
D -> Move left
SPACE -> Jump
LMB -> Attack

MY CONTRIBUTION :
1.Made the sprite for idle state and punching state of enemy using *PixelStudio*(Android Tab).
2.Background image for all th
e different scenes have been taken from *DeviantArt.com*
3.Background music for all the different scenes have been downloaded from *YouTube.com*
4.Animations created and used are all that were given in the sample apart from Enemy attacking.
